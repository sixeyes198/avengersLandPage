    <div class="text"><p><b>"Thor is the "God of Thunder",a member of the race known as the Asgardians,<br> 
        a group of humanoid beings from the pocket dimension of Asgard, the Realm Eternal.<br>
        Thor is the son of Odin, the All-Father and king of Asgard.<br> He was worshiped by the humans known as 
        Vikings and became part of Norse Mythology.<br> Armed with his enchanted Uru hammer Mjolnir,<br>
        which helps him to channel his godly energies, <br>he became the mightiest warrior in the Ten Realms. 
        When his irresponsible <br>and impetuous behavior became too much, Odin sent him to Midgard
        (more commonly known as Earth) <br>as a disabled mortal medical student named Donald Blake,
        stripped of his memory. After learning humility he regained his memory as well as his godly powers.
        <br>Thor went on to become a champion for Midgard as well as one of the founding members of the Avengers, 
        "Earth's Mightiest Heroes".</b></p>
