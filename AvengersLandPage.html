                <p>"Thor is the "God of Thunder",a member of the race known as the Asgardians,<br> 
                        a group of humanoid beings from the pocket dimension of Asgard, the Realm Eternal.<br>
                        Thor is the son of Odin, the All-Father and king of Asgard.<br> He was worshiped by the humans known as 
                        <!-- Vikings and became part of Norse Mythology.<br> Armed with his enchanted Uru hammer Mjolnir,<br>
                        which helps him to channel his godly energies, <br>he became the mightiest warrior in the Ten Realms. 
                        When his irresponsible <br>and impetuous behavior became too much, Odin sent him to Midgard
                        (more commonly known as Earth) <br>as a disabled mortal medical student named Donald Blake,
                        stripped of his memory. After learning humility he regained his memory as well as his godly powers.
                        <br>Thor went on to become a champion for Midgard as well as one of the founding members of the Avengers, 
                        "Earth's Mightiest Heroes".</p> -->
